# 📰 Fake News Headline Generator

A fun Python project that randomly generates **fake, hilarious news headlines** using random subjects, actions, and objects. Every time you run it, you get a new breaking news story!

---

## ✨ Features
- Generates random funny headlines.
- Uses the `random` module to shuffle subjects, actions, and objects.
- Keeps generating new headlines until you say "no".
- Lightweight and easy to run in any Python environment.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The program randomly picks:
   - One **subject** (like “Shahrukh Khan” or “A cat in India”)
   - One **action** (like “dances with” or “declares”)
   - One **object** (like “near Minar-e-Pakistan.” or “a plate of samosa.”)
2. It combines them into a **funny fake headline**.
3. You can keep generating new headlines until you type `no`.
