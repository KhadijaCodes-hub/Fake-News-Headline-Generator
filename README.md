## 🧠 How It Works
1. The program randomly picks:
   - One **subject** (like "Shahrukh Khan" or "A cat in India")
   - One **action** (like "dances with" or "declares")
   - One **object** (like "near Minar-e-Pakistan." or "a plate of samosa.")
2. It combines them into a **funny fake headline**.
3. You can keep generating new headlines until you type `no`.
